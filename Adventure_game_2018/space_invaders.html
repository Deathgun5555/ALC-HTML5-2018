The cause for this was the Feonn an alien species in the far reach of the galaxy. We should have seen this coming when our first deep space ship 'The Will For Adventure'(TWFA) went missing past the planet Pluto. We lost contact with them at 9:41 am on March 4th in the year 2041. She was the first of the planet Earths United Nations ship. A year later the UN first capital warship was 'The Avenger'(TA) picked up a contact on there scopes as 'The Avenger' supported by 17 light dreadnought, 10 cargo ships, 4 battleships, 2 aircraft carrier, and 1 prototype planet destroyer the odds were on are side we thought that we had the best guns, ships, and men and women sadly we were blind. The UN thought it would be a good idea to broadcast it as the ships arrived at the scene the only thing they could see was 'TWFA' shredded. As the brave pilots went out the scopes lite up in a bad way as the Admiral order all ships to battle stations, but it was too late as soon as the enemy ship approaches the battle was over in less than 15 min. All the ships were all wiped out and the whole world had seen it first hand. On this day known as the spark for destruction at 10:41 am on march 11th in the 2042 we declared war against them. Soon men and women of the UN were being drafted, as family members said goodbye there was not a lot of time to train the new recruit before the Feonn arrived.");
